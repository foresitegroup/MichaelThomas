    <h2><strong style="color: #002043;">1.</strong> Needs Analysis</h2>
    <br>

    &bull; The most important part of the process is the research phase. At this stage, we will work collaboratively with you as your recruiting arm to discuss the organization and the specifics of the desired role you are lookng to fill.<br>
    <br>

    &bull; Our understanding of the specific requirements will allow us to develop a Position Profile. This is both the "road map" for the specific search and a document that can be shared with candidates, summarizing the company, history and the position's scope/experience needed, as well as an outline of the ideal candidate's management competencies, work style, history and personality.

    <br>

    &bull; Our objective is to interview and critically evaluate the most promising professionals, thereby helping to expedite the hiring process by introducing you only to candidates who have a history of executive success and that can add great value to the position and your company's performance.<br>
    <br>

    &bull; We will communicate with you regularly throughout this process, sharing candidate feedback, complete search status updates and specific market information and findings of the specific search we are involved in.
