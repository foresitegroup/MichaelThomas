We pride ourselves on the working relationships we maintain with our clients and candidates. Here at Michael-Thomas Executive Search we discuss upfront what the effort will be and the value of our work.<br>
<br>

<strong>Retained Basis</strong> &mdash; Michael-Thomas Executive Search works very closely with our clients on an exclusive level as well as the methodology to find the right candidates for the job (see <a href="our-approach.php">Our Approach</a>). This service level fee is highly unique to the recruiting industry. We will only charge a one-time search deposit (1/3rd of the total fee up front) and the balance of the fee is paid only when the candidate is hired. No other fees are incurred by the client throughout the duration of the search project. This is a "win win" situation.<br>
<br>

<strong>Contingency Basis</strong> &mdash; Michael-Thomas Executive Search represents the best candidates and we know we will get to the finish line faster than the other channels employed to present top qualified candidates for your open positions.  We have built our reputation in filling open roles quickly from commencement of the search to offer letter. With this business model we ask for exclusivity for the duration of the search project and the fee is paid for after the candidate accepts and starts his/her new role. <a href="industries-served.php">Industry categories</a> we excel at.<br>
<br>

<strong>Placement Guarantee</strong> &mdash; Michael-Thomas Executive will guarantee a candidate placement for 180 days from the start date. For any reason a candidate is either terminated or leaves during that time period a replacement will be made at no additional charge.
